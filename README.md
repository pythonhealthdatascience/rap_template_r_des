## üìå Introduction

This repository provides a template for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models in R.

üòä **Simple:** Easy-to-follow code structure using [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/). Implements a simple M/M/s queueing model in which patients arrive, wait to see a nurse, have a consultation with the nurse and then leave.

‚ôªÔ∏è **Reproducible:** This template is designed to function as a RAP. It adheres to reproducibility recommendations from:

* ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice (as documented in `nhs_rap.md`).
* Recommendations from [Heather et al. 2025](TODO:ADDLINK) "*On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: a computational investigation using open models*" (as documented in `heather_2025.md`).

## üßê What are we modelling?

A **simulation** is a computer model that mimics a real-world system. It allows us to test different scenarios and see how the system behaves. One of the most common simulation types in healthcare is **DES**.

In DES models, time progresses only when **specific events** happen (e.g., a patient arriving or finishing treatment). Unlike a continuous system where time flows smoothly, DES jumps forward in steps between events. For example, when people (or tasks) arrive, wait for service, get served, and then leave.

One simple example of a DES model is the **M/M/s queueing model**, which is implemented in this template. In a DES model, we use well-known **statistical distributions** to describe the behaviour of real-world processes. In an M/M/s model we use:

* **Poisson distribution** to model patient arrivals - and so, equivalently, use an **exponential distribution** to model the inter-arrival times (time from one arrival to the next)
* **Exponential distribution** to model server times.

These can be referred to as Markovian assumptions (hence "M/M"), and "s" refers to the number of parallel servers available.

For this M/M/s model, you only need three inputs:

1. **Average arrival rate**: How often people typically arrive (e.g. patient arriving to clinic).
2. **Average service duration**: How long it takes to serve one person (e.g. doctor consultation time).
3. **Number of servers**: How many service points are available (e.g. number of doctors).

This model could be applied to a range of contexts, including:

| Queue | Server/Resource |
| - | - |
| Patients in a waiting room | Doctor's consultation
| Patients waiting for an ICU bed | Available ICU beds |
| Prescriptions waiting to be processed | Pharmacists preparing and dispensing medications |

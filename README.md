## üìå Introduction

This repository provides a template for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models in R.

üòä **Simple:** Easy-to-follow code structure using [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/). Implements a simple M/M/s queueing model in which patients arrive, wait to see a nurse, have a consultation with the nurse and then leave.

‚ôªÔ∏è **Reproducible:** This template is designed to function as a RAP. It adheres to reproducibility recommendations from:

* ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice (as documented in `nhs_rap.md`).
* Recommendations from [Heather et al. 2025](TODO:ADDLINK) "*On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: a computational investigation using open models*" (as documented in `heather_2025.md`).

‚ú® **Design practices:** Functions are documented with `roxygen2` docstrings and `lintr` is used to lint `.R` and `.Rmd` files.

üß± **Package structure:** The simulation code (`R/`) is structured as a little local R package. It is installed in our environment using `devtools::install()` and then `library(simulation)`. This means it can easily be used anywhere else in the directory - here, in `rmarkdown/` and `tests/` - without needing any additional code (e.g. no need to run `source()` with paths to the files).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>More information about the package structure</b></summary>

<br>

**Rationale:** As explained above, the package structure is helpful for sourcing the simulation code anywhere in the folder. Other benefits of this structure include:

* Encourages well-organised repository following **standardised** established R package structure, which ensures that the model and analysis code are kept seperate.
* Useful "built-in" features like **tests**, documentation of functions using **Roxygen**, documentation of data, and **package checks** (e.g. checking all imports are declared).
* If your analysis has a short run time, the `.Rmd` files could be stored in a `vignettes/` folder which will mean they **re-run with every package build/check**, and so any new run issues will be identified. However, in this project, the analysis was instead stored in `rmarkdown/` as the file paths to save outputs cause errors in `vignettes/` (as they will differ between your runs of the notebook, and runs during the package build process).
* Meet packaging **requirement** on the NHS "Levels of RAP" framework.

For more information on the rationale behind structuring research as an R package, check out:

* ["Open, Reproducible, and Distributable Research With R Packages"](https://dante-sttr.gitlab.io/r-open-science/) from the DANTE Project - for example, this page on [vignettes](https://dante-sttr.gitlab.io/r-open-science/reports-manuscripts.html).
* ["Sharing and organizing research products as R packages"](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01436-x) from Vuorre and Crump 2020

**Commands:** Helpful commands when working with the package include:

* `devtools::document()` to reproduce documentation in `man/` after changes to the docstrings.
* `devtools::check()` to build and check the package follows best practices.
* `devtools::install()` to load the latest version of the package into your environment.
* `devtools::test()` to run the tests in `tests/`.

## üßê What are we modelling?

A **simulation** is a computer model that mimics a real-world system. It allows us to test different scenarios and see how the system behaves. One of the most common simulation types in healthcare is **DES**.

In DES models, time progresses only when **specific events** happen (e.g., a patient arriving or finishing treatment). Unlike a continuous system where time flows smoothly, DES jumps forward in steps between events. For example, when people (or tasks) arrive, wait for service, get served, and then leave.

![Simple DES Animation](images/simple_des.gif)
*Simple model animation created using web app developed by Sammi Rosser (2024) available at https://github.com/hsma-programme/Teaching_DES_Concepts_Streamlit and shared under an MIT Licence.*

One simple example of a DES model is the **M/M/s queueing model**, which is implemented in this template. In a DES model, we use well-known **statistical distributions** to describe the behaviour of real-world processes. In an M/M/s model we use:

* **Poisson distribution** to model patient arrivals - and so, equivalently, use an **exponential distribution** to model the inter-arrival times (time from one arrival to the next)
* **Exponential distribution** to model server times.

These can be referred to as Markovian assumptions (hence "M/M"), and "s" refers to the number of parallel servers available.

For this M/M/s model, you only need three inputs:

1. **Average arrival rate**: How often people typically arrive (e.g. patient arriving to clinic).
2. **Average service duration**: How long it takes to serve one person (e.g. doctor consultation time).
3. **Number of servers**: How many service points are available (e.g. number of doctors).

This model could be applied to a range of contexts, including:

| Queue | Server/Resource |
| - | - |
| Patients in a waiting room | Doctor's consultation
| Patients waiting for an ICU bed | Available ICU beds |
| Prescriptions waiting to be processed | Pharmacists preparing and dispensing medications |

## üõ†Ô∏è Using this template

### Step 1: Create a new repository

1. Click on <kbd>Use this template</kbd>.
2. Provide a name and description for your new project repository.
3. Clone the repository locally: 

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo
cd repo
```

### Step 2: Set-up the development environment

<!-- TODO: Test and consider options here, as not happy with this. Given I struggled with backdating R and packages, I think it would be appropriate here to divide this into two things:
(a) The exact environment we used (which we would encourage for RAP)
(b) Considerations re-running later, if not possible to rebuild that exact environment (e.g. which R, which packages, are compatible, maintenance, DESCRIPTION, etc). -->

Load the R environment described in the `renv.lock` file (though note this won't fetch the version of R used - you would need to switch to that manually first):

```
renv::init()
renv::restore()
```

If facing issues with restoring this environment, an alternative is to set up a fresh environment based on the `DESCRIPTION`, but note that this may then install more recent package versions.

```
renv::init()
renv::install()
renv::snapshot()
```

There may also be system dependencies. The exact requirements will depend on your operating system, whether you have used R before, and what packages you have used. For example, when developing the template, we had to install the following for `igraph` (as explained [in their documentation](https://r.igraph.org/articles/installation-troubleshooting.html)):

```
sudo apt install build-essential gfortran
sudo apt install libglpk-dev libxml2-dev
```

### Step 3: Explore and modify

üîé Choose your desired licence (e.g. <https://choosealicense.com/>). If keeping an MIT licence, just modify the copyright holder in `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md`.

üîé Review the example DES implementation in `R/` and `rmarkdown/`. Modify and extend the code as needed for your specific use case.

üîé Check you still fulfil the criteria in `docs/nhs_rap.md` and `docs/heather_2025.md`.

üîé Adapt the template `README` provided at the end of this file.

üîé Create your own `CITATION.cff` file using [cff-init](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/).

üîé Update `DESCRIPTION` and entries in the current `NEWS.md` with your own details, versions, and create GitHub releases.

üîé Archive your repository (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).

üîé Complete the Strengthening The Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) checklist (`stress_des.md`) and use this to support writing publication/report, and attach as an appendice to report.

üîé **Tests**

To run tests:

```
devtools::test()
```

The repository contains a GitHub action `R-CMD-check.yaml` which will automatically run tests with new commits to GitHub, as part of the `devtools::check()` operation. This is continuous integration, helping to catch bugs early and keep the code stable. It will run the tests on three operating systems: Ubuntu, Windows and Mac.

<!--TODO: Double check this CI definitely flags test failures-->

üîé **Linting**

You can lint the `.R` and `.Rmd` files by running:

```
lintr::lint_package()
lintr::lint_dir("rmarkdown")
```

The `lint_package()` function will run on files typically included in a package (i.e. `R/`, `tests/`). This will not include `rmarkdown/` as it is not typical/excluded from our package build, and so we can lint that by specifying the directory for `lint_dir()`.

<br>

## ‚ùì How does the model work?

TBC <!-- TODO: Write this section -->

**Note:** This template does not include a **warm-up period**, as it is not natively supported by simmer and was not possible to implement. This was explored - as the simulation results returned by `get_mon_arrivals()` can be filtered to only include patients arriving after a warm-up period. This isn't possible for the `get_mon_resources()` results (which we use to derive utilisation). This is because it provides times for each resource, but doesn't specify whether each time is a start or end time. We examine results per resource, and when there are multiple resources, it wouldn't be possible to match the resource times to the patient items (to identify which are start and end times), as the patients end time may be later if they had other resources to visit (and vice versa, their start time may be earlier if they visited other resources prior).

## ‚è∞ Run time and machine specification

The overall run time will vary depending on how the template model is used. A few example implementations are provided in `rmarkdown/` and the run times for these were:

* `analysis.Rmd`: 42s
* `choosing_parameters.Rmd`: 56s
* `generate_exp_results.Rmd`: 0s

<!--TODO: Check these are up to date -->

These times were obtained on an Intel Core i7-12700H with 32GB RAM running Ubuntu 24.04.1 Linux.
